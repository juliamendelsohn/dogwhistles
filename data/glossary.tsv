Because apparently, promoting anti-scientific attitudes and conspiracy theories is only bad if trans people and their allies are (allegedly) doing it.	0

Conversely, soy and other forms of milk have come to symbolize weakness and effeminacy. In our analysis, we found that milk has been used as a thinly veiled allegory for racial purity. Several prominant figures from the white supremacist movement including Richard Spencer added milk bottle emojis to their Twitter profiles. The hashtags #MilkTwitter embraced and celebrated traditional gender norms and white-dominated patriarchy, while making fun of multiculturalism and feminism. Scholars such as Freeman (2013) contend that the contemporary white supremacist movement appropriated the long association of milk with the intellect. She points out that since the consumption of liberal amounts of milk and its products are associated with having a scientific mind and excelling in other intellectual activities, white supremacists appropriated it to convey their superiority among the racial groups. 	0

"Wheesht" is Scottish slang meaning "shush" or "be quiet." The hashtag was started after a Scottish TERF was charged with malicious communications for tweeting about about how she'd left a suffragette ribbon (interpreted by many as a noose due to the poor quality of the photo) near a Glasgow television studio where an actor known to support trans rights works. In one particularly hilarious example, TERF author Jessica Taylor tweeted pictures of how she allegedly "found" this hashtag scrawled in the sand on a beach during a morning walk with a stick in her hand. 	0

Similarly, 13/90 refers to a related claim that 90% of all violent interracial crimes in the U.S. are committed by Blacks against Whites. Never mind that these figures are decades old, and that based on numbers arrested, African Americans have gone from committing 49.3% (56,909/115,495) of all violent crimes in 1995 to 37% (172,980/470,890) of violent crimes in 2019, showing that this meme is out-dated and currently should be "13/37". Since these statistics are based on arrests, not convictions, they are subject to bias from racial profiling. One study estimated that as much as 16-33% of arrests of racial minorities could be due to racial profiling in areas that have not had police reform.	0

The phrase, based on the most succinct dictionary definitions of the word "woman," is an example of the argumentum ad dictionarium fallacy. The implication is that biological sex is inherent to womanhood because some dictionary definitions of "woman" include the word "female."  Some have drawn parallels between the "adult human female" meme and the "It's Okay to Be White" campaign started by white supremacists on 4chan in 2017. The goal of that campaign, as described by the Anti-Defamation League, was to "choose an ostensibly innocuous and inoffensive slogan, put that slogan on fliers bereft of any other words or imagery, then place the fliers in public locations" under the assumption that "liberals" would "react negatively to such fliers and condemn them or take them down, thus 'proving' that liberals did not even think it was 'okay' to be white." In a similar fashion, TERFs have weaponized the negative reaction that "adult human female" campaigns have received from those aware of their transphobic nature, using it to frame themselves as victims of cancel culture and oversensitive SJWs offended by the word "woman." TERFs were enraged when UK police investigated stickers with the "adult human female" slogan as hate speech in 2019. Such backlash is frequently cited by TERFs as "proof" of their conspiracy theory that gender-inclusive language is somehow a trans lobby plot to "erase women."	0

Affirmative action emerged in the late 1960s out of efforts to directly foster integration in schools and workplaces [and was broadly supported by the public into the 1980s]. Reagan set out to not only roll back but politicize affirmative action, and to spearhead this effort he appointed William Bradford Reynolds to head the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department...Under Reynolds, the Justice Department began highly public campaigns to oppose affirmative action, presenting numerous arguments to the Supreme Court that race-conscious remedies amounted to discrimination against innocent whites.  [Reagan's] broadsides against affirmative action constituted a form of dog whistle politics...In 1984, when Reagan won re-election in a landslide, the GOP platform had a new plank on affirmative action: ‚ÄòWe will resist efforts to replace equal rights with discriminatory quota systems and preferential treatment. Quotas are the most insidious form of discrimination: reverse discrimination against the innocent.‚Äô The document said nothing about race directly, but obviously ‚Äòthe innocent‚Äô meant innocent whites. Attacking affirmative action provided a way for the GOP to constantly force race‚Äìand the party‚Äôs defense of white interests‚Äì  into the national conversation.  	1

During the past year, the American people have been served up an unprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and entertainment industry, which link every possible weather event to global warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media dismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change coverage and instead crossed squarely into global warming advocacy.

They took it to exclude other races. The phrase ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù sprang up in response, ostensibly to argue all lives are equal because we are all human beings. However, Black Lives Matter was not intended to mean that other lives do not matter. In a world where Black people are stigmatised, marginalised, and discriminated against, Black Lives Matter simply recognises Black lives matter, too.   Responding to ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù with ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù derails the specific conversation about racism against Black people. The phrase is seen to dismiss, ignore, or deny these problems ‚Äî it shuts down this important discussion. US President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and other US conservatives like Rudy Guiliani, have used the phrase to criticise the Black Lives Matter movement. Through its use, ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù has also become associated with white supremacy, far-right nationalism and racism. So, ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù can be understood as a racist dog whistle ‚Äî a direct push-back against the Black Lives Matter movement. It is far from an innocent term celebrating the worth of all humanity.	1

Trump started using the slogan in the later months of his campaign, and despite requests from the Anti-Defamation League that he drop it, he stuck with it. Friday, he embraced the words as a unifying theme for his inaugural address. ‚ÄúFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,‚Äù Trump said on the Capitol steps. ‚ÄúFrom this day forward, it‚Äôs going to be only America First. America First.‚Äù  Those same words galvanized a mass populist movement against U.S. entry into the war in Europe, even as the German army rolled through France and Belgium in the spring of 1940.

The reality is that American-born babies, who are U.S. citizens, cannot petition for their parents to gain legal immigration status until they are 21 years old. Not exactly the shortcut to citizenship Republicans claim it is.  The ‚Äúanchor baby‚Äù narrative is politics at its worst ‚Äî serving mostly as a Republican dog-whistle, tapping into an implicit racial sentiment that suggests children of color are less than fully American or they‚Äôre just a vehicle for gaming the system.

It‚Äôs also packed with anti-Semitic dog whistles, anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Semitic vocabulary. I‚Äôm not even sure whether it makes sense to call them dog whistles. The four readily identifiable American bad guys in the ad are Hillary Clinton, George Soros (Jewish financier), Janet Yellen (Jewish Fed Chair) and Lloyd Blankfein (Jewish Goldman Sachs CEO).  These are standard anti-Semitic themes and storylines, using established anti-Semitic vocabulary lined up with high profile Jews as the only Americans other than Clinton who are apparently relevant to the story. As you can see by my transcription, the Jews come up to punctuate specific key phrases. Soros: ‚Äúthose who control the levers of power in Washington‚Äù; Yellen ‚Äúglobal special interests‚Äù; Blankfein ‚Äúput money into the pockets of handful of large corporations.‚Äù  This is an anti-Semitic ad every bit as much as the infamous Jesse Helms ‚Äòwhite hands‚Äô ad or the Willie Horton ad were anti-African-American racist ads. Which is to say, really anti-Semitic. You could even argue that it‚Äôs more so, given certain linguistic similarities with anti-Semitic propaganda from the 1930s. But it‚Äôs not a contest. This is an ad intended to appeal to anti-Semites and spread anti-Semitic ideas. That‚Äôs the only standard that really matters. This is intentional and by design. It is no accident.  Trump has electrified anti-Semites and racist groups across the country. His own campaign has repeatedly found itself speaking to anti-Semites, tweeting their anti-Semitic memes, retweeting anti-Semites. His campaign manager, Steven Bannon, is an anti-Semite. The Breitbart News site he ran and will continue running after the campaign has become increasingly open in the last year with anti-Semitic attacks and politics. 	1

People might not want to talk about that, but dads in the home most of the time actually works....I said they even changed the name to what you guys are now? Not dads or fathers anymore. What are they? Baby daddies. What a sad commentary for this nation 	Phil Bryant (Mississippi Governor)	December 11, 2018	Speech at Mississippi Summit on Criminal Justice Forum	jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/dec/12/governor-talks-criminal-justice-reform-first-step-/	racist	stereotype-based target group label	Formal/Offline	Black men are irresponsible	Newspaper, online media	Ko Bragg for the Jackson Free Press	jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/dec/12/governor-talks-criminal-justice-reform-first-step-/	There is a long-arching stereotype about absent black fathers that Bryant seemed to be alluding to with the "baby daddy" comment. Yet, a Centers for Disease Control study of fathers' engagement found that African American fathers were more likely than white fathers to be engaged with their children's lives. Research shows that media spread myths about absent and disengaged black fathers.  Despite the theme of the conference, Bryant also missed an opportunity to delve into the impacts of incarceration on the nuclear family. Fwd.Us found that one in two people in the United States have had an immediate family member incarcerated, one in five had a parent incarcerated, and one in seven had a spouse or co-parent behind bars.  As some reporters have put it: many black men are quite literally missing because they are behind bars or suffer from low life expectancies. "For every 100 black women in this age group living outside of jail, there are only 83 black men. Among whites, the equivalent number is 99, nearly parity," data from the New York Times' Upshot show.  This became particularly pertinent post-Ferguson, where a police officer shot and killed teenager Michael Brown in broad daylight in 2014, launching years of protest and demands for police reform. In 2015, The New York Times found that of cities with at least 10,000 residents, Ferguson had the single largest proportion of missing black men. Economist Stephen Bronars found that in 2015, there were more than two young black women for each young black man in Ferguson.

The question raises the disproportionate levels of crime in black communities ‚Äî particularly the thousands of homicides each year in which the offender and victim are black ‚Äî to, on its face, argue that people should worry about black-on-black crime before they worry about police brutality. (Although this ignores the work that many black leaders have done in this area on top of their work on criminal justice issues.)  But it's also playing on a racist idea: that black people are all criminals, so they deserve to be treated differently. The idea is that since crime is higher in black communities, police are justified in going into these places and essentially doing as they wish.  It's true that crime is higher in black communities. But simplifying the connection between racial disparities in the justice system and crime misses other factors, like implicit bias. A review of the research by the Sentencing Project concluded that throughout various periods in the past few decades, the higher crime rates in black communities only explained about 61 to 80 percent of black overrepresentation in prisons.  Nonetheless, concern trolling about black-on-black crime is a very successful way to divert the conversation by playing into racist stereotypes that paint black people as criminals. It shows another way coded language can work: It can be used to signal that white people shouldn't really care about an issue affecting a certain group, because, the thinking goes, that group brought it upon itself. 	1

The term boogaloo is derived from the 1984 movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo which is a commonly used phrase online to indicate any sort of sequel, particularly a poor quality one. Big igloo is a derivative synonym that refers to boogaloo  and probably to the "big tent" idea of inclusiveness (but for white people since igloos are white), but more likely as a way of evading attempts at moderation. In search of further homophone-ish phrases for their shitposting, this term further morphed into the phrase big luau online, as a reference to the unusually high number of "Boogaloo Boys" posting images wearing Hawaiian shirts. This led to a bizarre situation during lockdown protests regarding the 2019-20 COVID-19 outbreak, where many of the far-right extremists that attended showed their devotion to white supremacy by (in reference to the luau) dressing in Hawaiian shirts.	1

This term is most frequently assigned to Black families and is part of the larger set of narratives that hold white and non-white people to different standards. It wrongly signals that the challenges Black people face are of their own making, the result of dysfunctional or irresponsible choices. As this logic goes, families are broken because the people in them are broken: it‚Äôs not that social injustice has broken them, it‚Äôs that they are inherently inferior as people, as evidenced by their class and race. It‚Äôs always about them, not the system. Using this term, especially in the context of Black families, infuses any conversation with this entire line of thinking and judgment‚Äîwhether explicitly or unconsciously. It also presents Black families as hopeless: perpetually broken and unable to be set right,people who get what they deserve given the ‚Äúchoices‚Äù they have made...  Public opinion rooted in conservatism and religious values has never accepted families that deviate from the traditional two-married-parent nuclear family home, and punishes families that do not fit into this model. But in the context of talking about Black families, the term runs deeper: the idea that Black people are incapable of creating successful family structures and that Black children raised by single mothers are delinquent.  The term ‚Äúbroken home‚Äù not only lacks empathy and accuracy, it lacks specificity. While highly racialized, it is used to describe everything from divorce and single-parent homes to abuse or poverty, rendering it practically meaningless.	1

Despite the fact that pandemics can start anywhere and ‚Äî by definition ‚Äî spread beyond geopolitical boundaries, these politicians have stood by their use of terms like ‚ÄúWuhan virus‚Äù and ‚Äúforeign virus,‚Äù ignoring examples of Asians being verbally and physically assaulted due to being linked with the new coronavirus.  Despite WHO‚Äôs efforts, leading U.S. conservative politicians and influencers have continued embracing such terminology as ‚Äúdog whistles‚Äù ‚Äî coded language that can be used to denigrate a group while publicly denying you are doing it ‚Äî that implicitly blame Chinese people for the viral outbreak. While such language has circulated online since the early days of the outbreak, it was not until well after WHO‚Äôs efforts to push back against stigmatizing terms that needlessly divisive COVID-19 rhetoric erupted more broadly within online conservative political discourse. Some conservatives have even embraced using these terms as a badge of honor, such as Jack Posobiec temporarily changing his Twitter name to ‚ÄúWuhan Jack.‚Äù  The widespread online debate about COVID-19 and dog-whistle rhetoric was sparked on March 8 following a tweet from U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, in which the Republican lawmaker from Arizona referred to COVID-19 as ‚ÄúWuhan virus.‚Äù According to Trendinalia, a tool used to monitor trending topics on Twitter, the phrase ‚ÄúWuhan virus‚Äù began trending that same day and into the next. Predominantly Democratic politicians and progressive influencers on Twitter repudiated Rep. Gosar‚Äôs word choice and decried the politician for the implications of the terminology. But even well-intentioned tweets highlighting Rep. Gosar‚Äôs phrasing became a form of amplification in itself, feeding the term more oxygen by distributing it to a broader public.

Now those same old tropes are being used to call the loyalty into question, not only of immigrants in the UK and British expats, but also of well-educated British people who feel cosmopolitan, or who dare to have an ethnically diverse workforce‚Ä¶.  Hitler and others used charges of cosmopolitanism against Jews, pitting them against the native-born population, described by Hitler in his 1933 campaign speech to Siemens factory workers as ‚Äúpeople [who] are bounded to their soil, bounded to its fatherland, bounded to the possibilities of life that the state ‚Ä¶ offers‚Äù. By contrast, Hitler described Jews as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a small, rootless, international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace. It is the people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have anywhere a soil on which they have grown up, but who live in Berlin today, in Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after that, and then again in Prague or Vienna or London, and who feel at home everywhere.‚Äù	1

This means that male-to-female sex changes are a natural part of their reproductive biology. Clownfish schools are led by a female. When this female dies, the dominant male changes sex and takes her place, becoming a fertile (i.e. egg-producing) female. TERF references to clownfish are intended to mock and otherize trans women, suggesting that the idea humans can change sex is absurd because humans are not fish. This also meshes with the Clown World dogwhistle.	0

They contend that colorblindness means government should never take race into account, not even as a way to promote racial equality....by 1965, a conservative form of colorblindness had emerged: according to the newest friends of the theory, the Constitution forbade any state use of race, whether to segregate or--and this was the real agenda--to integrate.  Colorblindness lies at the heart of the contemporary belief held by many whites that they are the true racial victims in US society today‚Ä¶It sounds liberal yet works like a racial cudgel, denying that there‚Äôs discrimination against minorities, elevating whites as racial victims, justifying white superiority, and facilitating dog whistle racial appeals that emphasize culture and comportment.   And one more thing: colorblindness also protects dog whistle race-baiting against charges of racism. Even though conservatives repeatedly use an ethnic vocabulary, they always hold in reserve the colorblind insistence that race is just a matter of blood. This provides a stock defense of dog whistling, for it allows politicians to demagogue culture and behavior, while insisting that they cannot possibly be engaged in racial pandering because they have not directly referenced biology	1

In such hands, CRT became a catch-all for any teaching about race and American history.  ‚ÄúIt is a very convenient soundbite for encapsulating everything about the reckoning after George Floyd‚Äôs death and the Black Lives Matter movement,‚Äù said Tanya Hern√°ndez, a law professor at Fordham University in New York. ‚ÄúThose who are making a lot of noise about critical race theory have no interest in learning what it‚Äôs really about because it‚Äôs not their focal point, just a nice encapsulation as a reference point of everything they don‚Äôt like. They don‚Äôt want any discussion about the accuracy and the truthfulness of our racial histories to be taught to children.‚Äù  It proved the right dog-whistle in the right place at the right time. Youngkin tapped into a surge of frustration among suburban parents after months of school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. This included grumbles about teachers‚Äô unions, mask mandates and what they witnessed about their children‚Äôs education during months of remote learning.  Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, a group opposed to Donald Trump and Trumpism, said: ‚ÄúRepublicans are the masters at finding an issue playing on the racial resentment and grievance within the Republican party base and creating this perception that somehow this is a threat to children, to white America, and some type of invasion of the education system. ‚ÄúCritical race theory doesn‚Äôt even exist here and most people don‚Äôt know what it is. But it is a masterclass in how perception is reality and, when propaganda isn‚Äôt pushed back on, it can metastasise in ways that become problematic in campaigns. That‚Äôs exactly what happened in Virginia.‚Äù  Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: ‚ÄúLee Atwater, who was considered one of the greatest Republican political operatives, understood that racial resentment animates a lot of white suburban voters and you can manipulate that to get people to the polls.

Many members of the Frankfurt School fled Nazism and came to the United States, which is where they supposedly uploaded the virus of cultural Marxism to America. These zany stories of the Frankfurt School‚Äôs role in fomenting political correctness would be entertaining, except that they echo the baseless allegations of tiny cabals ruling the world that fed the right‚Äôs paranoid imagination in prior eras.  The wider discourse around cultural Marxism today resembles nothing so much as a version of the Judeobolshevik myth updated for a new age. In the years after the Russian Revolution, fantasists took advantage of the fact that many of its instigators were Jewish to suggest that people could save time by equating Judaism and communism ‚Äî and kill off both with one blow. As the historian Paul Hanebrink recounts in an unnerving new study, according to the Judeobolshevik myth, the instigators of communism were the Jews as a whole, not some tiny band of thinkers, conniving as a people to bring communist irreligion and revolution worldwide.  The results of such beliefs weren‚Äôt pretty. According to Professor Hanebrink, many aspects of the Judeobolshevik fantasy survived the Holocaust it helped bring about, just with the role of the Jews implied more euphemistically or replaced by new adversaries. As in Judeobolshevism, cultural Marxism homogenizes vast groups of shadowy enemies and assigns them a secret design to upend society. As in Judeobolshevism, those supposedly under threat are invited to identify themselves with ‚Äúthe Christian West‚Äù and surge in self-defense before it is too late.	1

In the 1980s and 90s, it became widespread in these settings as: a coded expression for everything they dislike about the immigration and refugee politics and as a joke on the anti-racists, who have often cited culture enrichment, exotic food, and folk dance as arguments for increased immigration. Neo-Nazi papers from this time show use of culture enricher as a synonym to immigrant, and as a commetary of the issues that immigrant related crime, violence, attitudes, and culture bring to Swedish society.	0

Bush mentioned the Dred Scott decision in a presidential debate. His language simply referenced the disastrous 1857 decision for some viewers, but it had a different meaning for others. Bush's curious Dred Scott reference in the context of a question about judicial nominations was arguably a way to signal to Christian conservatives that he would nominate a justice who disagreed with Roe v. Wade (Kirkpatrick 2004). The two cases have been linked in the Christian, pro-life community based on their association between slavery and abortion. They argue that abortion and slavery are both instances where the strong, or politically powerful, have a responsibility to protect the week, and that an overly activist Supreme Court erred in both Dred Scott and Roe v. Wade by not recognizing the humanity in slaves and the unborn (Buckley 2000). The appeal was targeted based on its limited cultural resonance; the appeal only signaled abortion to a narrow subset of the population. Given the controversial nature of an anti-Roe v. Wade signal, the specificity of the cue was strategic.	0

Dual loyalty accusations also occur on U.S. college campuses when Jewish students are asked to denounce the actions of the Israeli government in order to participate in progressive activities. By accusing Jews of being disloyal citizens whose true allegiance is to Israel or a hidden Jewish agenda (see globalist), antisemites sow distrust and spread harmful ideas‚Äîlike the belief that Jews are a traitorous ‚Äúfifth column,‚Äù meaning they are undermining their country from within. The allegation of dual loyalty can also be aimed at non-Jews for what antisemites see as being ‚Äúexcessively loyal to Israel,‚Äù a criticism rarely leveled against friends and supporters of other countries (see Figure D5). For centuries, these antisemitic accusations of disloyalty have led to the harassment, marginalization, oppression, and murder of Jewish people. (AJC Translate Hate glossary)  	1

(The name of his latest book is "Crippled America.") President Obama talked about this at some length yesterday, saying that Trump was "exploiting" these peoples' fears. And they do have a right to be afraid. As anyone who's been following the political discussion about income inequality over the past few years knows, they are losing ground. The latest research shows that the incomes of the top 20% grew on average 42.6% since 1979, the middle only grew 9.5% and the bottom 20% actually fell by 2.7%. Many of these non-college educated white working class Trump fans are either in what we would call the lower middle class or among the lower 20%. If they are anxious you cannot blame them.  On the other hand, there is an assumption that somehow Trump's message is speaking to this particular complaint and that is questionable. Trump, after all, is the guy who said in a debate in answer to a question about whether he supported a raise in the minimum wage that he not only didn't support the raise but that he thinks wages are already too high! He went on "Morning Joe" the next morning and made his case even more strenuously. It makes little sense that such a message would resonate with these white working class people who are flocking to his rallies. No, whatever is drawing them Trump it certainly isn't the fact that these people are disaffected economically and Trump is offering them the road to riches.  What if it isn't that these angry working class whites are attracted to Trump because he's giving voice to their economic problems at all, whether by offering some vague notion of "making America great again" or telling them their problems are caused by undocumented workers? What if their "anxiety" is really just about simple racism --- the fact that people they believe are inferior to them are becoming equal in society?  That these white folks might sincerely be more upset about African Americans becoming equal or undocumented immigrants destroying "American culture" or Muslims worshipping a religion they find threatening and weird than their own economic well-being is an unsettling thought. But it's very hard to ignore the fact that in good times and bad it still exists. As Bouie wrote: These voters may feel anxious about their economic status. But they also hold racial and cultural resentments. They‚Äôre worried about their futures and they dislike immigrants, Muslims, and blacks.  And Trump is pushing the racial and cultural resentment button a lot harder than he's pushing the economic button. In fact, he's pushing the resentment button so hard that it's activated some very serious racists who truly had been pushed to the fringes of the right wing fever swamps. According to a rather disturbing story this week in the Washington Post there has been a surge of excitement among white supremacists. It quotes a number of different leaders of the movement who are thrilled at the prospect of one of their "own" getting mainstream credibility. Trump is often said by his followers to be "saying what they're thinking." These racists feel exactly the same way.	1

That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them...".  [Romney's speech] was a testament to the triumph of dogwhistle politics. How so, if Romney disparaged half the country and never mentioned race? On one level, the answer lies in the language of dependency, entitlement, and lack of responsibility. It's clear from his larger campaign that Romney understood the power of such coded language. He seemed to learn from the primary contest, where Newt Gingrish made hay by lambasting Obama as the food stamp president. Seeking to make welfare a major issue in the race, during the 2012 summer Romney produced several TV ads slamming Obama for allegedly ending the requirement that welfare recipients actively seek employment...It was for this relatively crude racial demagoguery that many commentators criticized Romney. His welfare ads were sharply attacked as dogwhistle politics...  But there was another level of dog whistle politics evident in Romney's campaign, a deeper connection far more consequential to the middle class yet completely unseen by most critics. Romney's true debt to dog whistle politics lay in his ability to garner widespread support while espousing plutocratic priorities...he would pare government entitlement programs that transferred resources to the least productive elements in society. 	1
entitlement spending	entitlement spending; government spending; government entitlement spending	Over the past decades we've talked of curtailing government spending so that we can then lower the tax burden. Sometimes we've even taken a run at doing that. But there were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cure their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance...We must increase productivity. That means making it possible for industry to modernize and make use of the technology which we ourselves invented. That means putting Americans back to work. And that means above all bringing government spending back within government revenues, which is the only way, together with increased productivity, that we can reduce and, yes, eliminate inflation.

In 2007, with the budget deficit ballooning to historic highs, Heritage reversed course and looked to dog whistle appeals to cover up how wrong they and the Bush administration had been. Now, they claimed that it was "entitlement spending" that was dwarfing the "projected large revenue increases" that the tax cuts had supposedly generated. According to the rightwing narrative coming out of Heritage, the deficit was not the result of a massive transfer of wealth to the rich but of government social aid programs. Hesitancy regarding dog whistle politics may have increased, but oligarchy-friendly policies continued to need the cover provided by racial narratives about out of control liberal programs.	1

They insist that recognising trans women as women will render the word "woman" meaningless, allowing "men" (trans women) to force their way into women's sports, women's shelters, women's spots on public boards, and women's award nominations. This will somehow enable (cis) women to be subjugated as they have since time immemorial, except now the oppression is of an exceedingly vague, unverifiable nature.  TERFs also object to language intended to be inclusive of trans men (on the rare occasion they acknowledge their existence). Phrases like "people who menstruate" and "pregnant people" acknowledge that trans men and AFAB enbies also experience menstruation and pregnancy, and that neither of those things are universal experiences even among cis women. Many cis women of child-bearing age don't have periods regularly or at all due to health conditions like polycystic ovary syndromeWikipedia and pretty much every cis women over the age of 50 no longer menstruates due to menopause. Defining womanhood by reproductive biology isn't helpful or all that feminist. As TERFs have it, however, inclusive language is a Very Bad Thing and an evil trans lobby plot. Fair Play for Women released a press statement ominously warning that the "very words we use to describe ourselves as a sex class are being erased." According to the group, phrases like "menstruator," "uterus-haver," and "people with a vagina" are a "dehumanising" affront to (cis) women, not a concise and practical way for media reports and health campaign literature to include trans and non-binary people. The alternative would be clunky wording like "cis women, trans men, and non-binary people with uteruses." Many of the phrases TERFs object to most vehemently aren't even used that much. No one refers to cis women as "cervix-owners" outside of narrow contexts like trying to educate people about the necessity of regular cervical cancer screenings. TERFs nonetheless screech that cis women are "losing the words we need to talk about our bodies, our needs and our rights." Nevermind what words trans people (who aren't really people after all /s) and many cis people might prefer to use to discuss their bodies, their needs, and their rights.  Some of the more batshit, conspiracy-minded TERFs have even speculated that uterus transplants, artificial wombs, and other emerging reproductive technologies might allow "men" (a category which, in their bigoted minds, includes trans women) to somehow "erase women from existence completely."	1

family values	family values; traditional family values	As modern life brings changes in our society, it also puts stresses on families trying to adjust to new realities while maintaining cherished values. Economic uncertainty, unemployment, housing difficulties, women's and men's concerns with their changing and often conflicting roles, high divorce rates, threatened neighborhoods and schools, and public scandal all create a hostile atmosphere that erodes family structures and family values. Thus it is imperative that our government's programs, actions, officials and social welfare institutions never be allowed to jeopardize the family.

Steve Bannon	August 5, 2022	Speech at Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)	https://www.c-span.org/video/?522199-1/conservative-political-action-conference-steve-bannon-seth-dillon	antisemitic	representative (Bogeyman)	Formal/Offline	Jewish people control all the money	Nonprofit Organization	Spencer Sunshine for Political Research Associates	https://politicalresearch.org/2018/01/12/steve-bannons-washed-out-antisemitism	Another approach by antisemites is to deploy conspiracy theories that name agents like like ‚Äúinternational bankers‚Äù or organizations like the Federal Reserve. In the original form, for example, the Federal Reserve was accused of being formed by Jewish bankers. ‚ÄúInternational bankers‚Äù became a commonly used code word referring to Jews, as well.  However, when someone invokes these conspiracy theories today, they may or may not be aware of these histories. Here, the background of the speaker is of importance; we should treat the use of these differently if a known antisemite like Duke invokes them, rather than if they are espoused by an otherwise unproblematic left-wing critic of globalization.  However, the intention of the speaker does not necessarily have anything to do with the impact of the narrative. In both cases, the speaker is using the emotional power of the antisemitic narrative: an apocalyptic battle between a secretive evil elite and a virtuous people. And, intentionally or not, these narratives are also received by some listeners as code words: antisemites will understand that the Federal Reserve and the international bankers refer to the Jewish conspiracy.  While it can be argued whether conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve, international bankers, or the New World Order constitute antisemitism when used by otherwise unproblematic actors, they are both politically fallacious world views, and anyone who takes antisemitism seriously would avoid the use of these terms and narratives because of their histories.  In Bannon‚Äôs case, he has read the classics of reactionary nationalist literature, and understands very well that some of his listeners will interpret the constant invocations of classic antisemitic images and narratives to mean ‚Äúthe Jews.‚Äù Just as with his approach to ethno-nationalists, it appears that Bannon wants a ‚Äúwashed out‚Äù antisemitism, based directly on the antisemitic narrative structure and using its imagery (octopuses, puppet masters, cliques of international banker) while either naming individual Jews, or groups that others had previously been identified as Jewish (as the Frankfurt School, the Federal Reserve), as the villains. He is no doubt intentionally using these narratives to appeal to both antisemites and those who don‚Äôt understand the double meaning‚Äî while simultaneously inoculating against accusations of antisemitism.	0

It‚Äôs not new but has recently bubbled up to the surface again in recent weeks ‚Äî and it promulgates the belief that Jews are merely ‚Äúmasquerading‚Äù as whites as a way to tear down the white nation from the inside.  The meme is sometimes accompanied with a modified version of the ‚Äúhappy merchant‚Äù meme ‚Äî picturing the hook-nosed anti-Semitic caricature wearing a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù mask.  The meme is meant to highlight what the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù sees as the ‚Äúshapeshifting‚Äù and ultimately non-white nature of Jews. Jews, the thinking goes, call themselves white when they want to appeal to ‚Äúfellow whites‚Äù ‚Äî and call for things like immigration reform or civil rights ‚Äî but also call themselves members of a minority class when it suits them.  The broader debate around Jews and whiteness is fraught and breaks out within the Jewish community every few months. What this meme suggests is that, regardless of what any Jew may feel, the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù sees them as non-whites.	0

In this context, it wasn't heavily stigmatized. Fast-forward to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson made it clear that he wanted it to have a racial-justice component. "Then it becomes possible for conservatives to start painting welfare as a transfer of wealth to minorities," says Lopez. Remember those Reagan speeches about welfare queens? Today, says L√≥pez, we hear "food stamps" used similarly.	1

Californias Superintendent of Public Instruction, Wilson Riles (himself a Black), says The concept that Black children cant learn unless they are sitting with white children is utter and complete nonsense. Well, I agree. The money now being wasted on this social experiment could be better spent to provide the kind of school facilities every child deserves. Forced busing should be ended by legislation if possible by constitutional amendment if necessary. And, control of education should be returned to local school districts.

freedom of association	freedom of association	It is wrong to compel children to attend schools restricted to members of their own race, however that may be defined. It is also wrong to forbid children to attend schools restricted to members of another race. I condemn that sort of segregation because it is compulsory.  There is another way that people may separate and distinguish themselves from each other. Far from being compulsory, it is the necessary result of freedom-the freedom of association.   Throughout this land of ours, we find people forming churches, clubs, and neighborhoods with other families of similar beliefs, similar tastes, and similar ethnic backgrounds. No one would think of insisting that neighborhoods be "integrated" with fixed proportions of Anglo-Americans, German-Americans, Swedish-Americans-or of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews.   To me, it is wrong to take some children out of the schools they would normally attend and bus them to others-just to get a mixture of ethnic and racial groups that somebody thinks is desirable.

For the far right, from Russia to central Europe and increasingly, America, Soros is the latest Jewish manipulator whose extreme wealth finances puppet groups and publications to drain the prosperity of the Herrenvolk. This cannot be dismissed as the preoccupation of ignorable fools on the internet, nor as the equivalent of liberal criticism of the Koch Brothers. Instead, the attack on Soros follows classic anti-Semitic templates, grimly recurrent throughout western history, and some of the most powerful geopolitical figures in the world are pushing it. It‚Äôs fueled by Soros‚Äôs political activism against a revanchist right eager to view the world in zero-sum racial terms that is on the march across Europe, America and beyond.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to distinguish between intent and effect. Of course a person who shares a conspiracy theory about George Soros may not intend to promulgate anti-Semitism, and of course not every Soros conspiracy theory is anti-Semitic. But the image of the rich, powerful Jew who manipulates social and political movements around the world for his own agenda is an ancient anti-Semitic trope,‚Äù said Aryeh Tuchman, the associate director of the Anti-Defamation League‚Äôs Center on Extremism.  ‚ÄúBecause Soros‚Äôs Jewish identity is so well known, we are concerned that conspiracy theories about George Soros may have the effect of reinforcing this trope and spreading it throughout the broader population,‚Äù Tuchman added. ‚ÄúThis is especially true when other anti-Semitic tropes are woven in, such as claims that Soros controls the media or the banks, or when he is described using terms that harken back to medieval claims that Jews are evil, demonic, or agents of the Antichrist.‚Äù	1

Although the term is not inherently anti-Semitic, ‚Äúglobalist‚Äù is often used as a pejorative term for people whose interests in international commerce or finance ostensibly make them disloyal to the country in which they live, or who are willing to undermine the financial security of their neighbors in order to benefit transnational interests. Because of the long history of anti-Semitic associations of Jews with money and commerce, and allegations that Jews place their transnational ethnic affiliations ahead of the interests of their non-Jewish neighbors, these pejorative subtexts quickly take on anti-Semitic connotations when the term is applied to individual Jews, groups of Jews, or places where Jews are known to live (i.e. ‚ÄúNew York globalists‚Äù). Anti-Semites frequently use the term ‚ÄúGlobalist‚Äù as a code word for Jews. 	1

It was roughly equivalent to the modern "Ms." or "Mrs." since it was usually (but not always) applied to married women.  TERFs often use it before their surnames or account names (e.g., "Goody Rowling") as a reference to Goody Ann Glover, who, in 1688, was hanged as a witch in Boston, the last person to suffer such a fate in the city. The insinuation is that TERFs are also innocent women being persecuted by trans women in exceedingly vague and unverifiable ways.	0

In modern contexts, however, it refers to anyone who is not Jewish. Among Hebrew- and Yiddish-speakers the term is standard for referring to non-Jews, and has no racist or xenophobic connotations. English-speakers often regard the word as derogatory, and may employ the terms "gentile" or "non-Jew" instead. Google's dictionary defines the term as informal and derogatory. The Oxford English Dictionary regards the noun as often pejorative, but not the adjective.  While Jewish people in the diaspora often frivolously use the term, the term is often employed by cranks, antisemites, and conspiracy theorists to make Jewish people sound racist. If someone uses the term "goy" in an argument having to do with the Federal Reserve, Israel, Zionism, or any other possible crank magnet, chances are you are arguing with a racist lunatic and it is not worth continuing. If they use any variation on the anti-semitic cliche "Oy vey, the goyim know, shut it down!", then those chances shoot up to a near-certainty.  There is a recurring canard among conspiracy theorists and antisemites alike that the term "goyim" means "cattle" in Hebrew. The actual Hebrew word for "cattle" is "bakar". As noted above, the word 'goy' translates to "nation", including that of Israel.  The term "shabbos goy" refers to a non-Jew who does work for Jews that observant Jews are otherwise not allowed to do during the Sabbath due to religious restrictions. Antisemites also often use the term to refer to people who are alleged to be doing the "dirty work" for the Jews.	0

But this rhetoric also harkens back to age-old attacks on the LGBTQ community. Casting LGBTQ people as child predators and their very existence as something inherently sexual was a tactic used by anti-LGBTQ activists since the 1970s in their efforts to stifle or roll back LGBTQ legal protections, according to Marie-Am√©lie George, a law professor at Wake Forest University who specializes in LGBTQ rights.

welfare reform	welfare reform, welfare overhaul	In 1996, President Clinton and a bipartisan Congress helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare.

Under Obama‚Äôs plan, you wouldn‚Äôt have to work and wouldn‚Äôt have to train for a job. They just send you a welfare check. And welfare-to-work goes back to being plain old welfare. Mitt Romney will restore the work requirement because it works.	Mitt Romney (2012 Republican Presidential Nominee)	August 7, 2012	Campaign Ad	https://archive.nytimes.com/campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/making-the-election-about-race/	racist	concept (policy)	Formal/Offline	Eliminate government aid to racial minorities	Media	Patrick Caldwell for The American Prospect	https://prospect.org/power/romney-s-race-based-initiative/	Many voters may not detect the subtle politics of race at work here, but it speaks clearly to the subsection of the public that equates redistribution with handouts to poor minorities‚Ä¶   This reading is backed up by political science. As Martin Gilens notes in his 1999 book,¬†Why Americans Hate Welfare: Race, Media, and the Politics of Antipoverty Policy, there is a strong correlation between views on race and opposition to welfare. "Most white Americans believe that blacks are less committed to the work ethic than are whites, and this belief is strongly related to opposition to welfare," Gilens writes. This association began in the mid-1960s, when, Gilens notes, the ratio of African-Americans in photos attached to articles about poverty jumped drastically. Until then, Americans largely associated poverty with Appalachia, but as depictions of poverty changed, so did stereotypes. "Despite the fact that African Americans constitute only 36 percent of welfare recipients and only 27 percent of poor Americans, whites' attitudes toward poverty and welfare are dominated by their beliefs about blacks," Gilens says‚Ä¶  Romney's motivation for racially motivated attacks is fairly simple. As Ruy Teixeira¬†explains¬†at¬†The New Republic, the fate of his campaign hinges in part on his vote share among working-class whites. Obama lost this group by 18 percent in 2008, but they turned on Democrats by 30 points in 2010, handing Republicans control of the House. If Obama gets around 38 percent of the white vote in 2012, he should hold his spot in the White House. Romney isn't quite reaching an adequate level of support among those voters. White seniors are the other demographic Romney needs to win by a wide margin in November, a group also primed to be receptive to this rhetorical shift. To appeal to these voters and counter Obama's narrative that the economy is in the doldrums thanks to Wall Street profiteering, Romney has turned to the politics of downward resentment.  The Romney campaign's characterization of Obama completes the picture-it portrays the president as an angry black man who is exacting racial revenge on whites by giving undeserving minorities your money. It plays straight into a stereotype of black men, an image Obama has distanced himself from.	0

In that contest's waning days, Clinton used race to make a last ditch argument that she was more electable than Obama: "I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on," she explained in an interview, citing a recent poll that she said "found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both [Indiana and North Carolina] who had not completed college were supporting me." Clinton's equation of "hard-working Americans" with "white Americans" struck many as a form of intentional dog whistling. Perhaps it was, though maybe this linkage was merely an unconscious slip, even if one that revealed the cultural power of the stereotypes contrasting supposedly hardworking whites and lazy blacks.	1

Hollywood elite	Hollywood elite; Hollywood elites; Hollywood; Hollywood liberals; Hollywood moguls	Hollywood elites continue to do everything they can to support Radical Raphael and Jon Ossoff, as the cast of Whose Line Is It Anyway? hosts a virtual fundraiser for Georgia‚Äôs radical liberal Democrat candidates for Senate.  Just today, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: ‚ÄúNearly 80% of the money raised in the fall campaign for Warnock, the Democrat running against Loeffler, came from outside Georgia.

Dog-whistle is constantly used as a tactic by QAnon to denounce prominent Jewish public figures and the global Jewry in ways that are all too familiar. Since the encoded language within QAnon might not be apparent at first sight, this aspect needs further explanation. In the following, this chapter will present most common QAnon conspiracy myths and show how they apply a coded or suggestive antisemitic language‚Ä¶  ...By 2020, QAnon followers were advancing a story that ‚ÄúHollywood elites‚Äù were engaged in ‚Äúadrenochrome harvesting,‚Äù in which the hormone adrenaline is extracted from tortured children‚Äôs blood to be oxidized into the psychoactive drug adrenochrome‚Ä¶Many of the ‚ÄúHollywood elites‚Äù accused of committing these crimes against children are not Jewish. QAnon believers accused, for instance, Oprah Winfrey of being a key figure in their alleged vast sex trafficking ring. Nonetheless, the critique of the ‚Äúliberal Hollywood elites‚Äù is rooted in antisemitism. As early as in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan complained about the ‚Äúimmoral films being produced by the ‚ÄòJew-controlled‚Äô Hollywood film industry.‚Äù The Dearborn Independent, a newspaper owned by industrialist Henry Ford, claimed that there was a ‚ÄúJewish supremacy‚Äù which was under the control of the ‚ÄúJewish manipulators of the public mind.‚Äù Even in the 1970s, Jews were accused by the American far-right of promoting ‚Äúanti-Christian and anti-American pictures‚Äù (Gillis, 2017, pp. 267, 280). In 1964, 50% of Americans believed that ‚Äúthe Jews‚Äù controlled Hollywood; in 2008, this number went down to only 22%. But this is still a high number, as Anti-Defamation League chairman Abe Foxman pointed out. Although it is true that Jews are disproportionately represented in the American creative industry, Foxman said, the idea that ‚Äúthe Jews‚Äù control Hollywood is ‚Äúvery dangerous‚Äù (Stein, 2020). These antisemitic legends resonate well with QAnon‚Äôs claim of Hollywood actors harvesting adrenochrome from children.	1

TERFs of course view trans women as men. It's also based on a pathologization of transfeminine bottom surgery. TERFs are morbidly fixated on a form of vaginoplasty sometimes used in gender-confirmation surgery. This procedure involves colon tissue grafts, as this allows the vagina to be self-lubricating. TERFs are convinced that all trans women undergo this procedure, and thus that their vaginas must be smelly and gross. It's also been noted that the term "hygienic" has an extremely problematic history.	1

However, Rowling dropped the mask and revealed herself to be a TERF in late 2019, confirming years of speculation based on dodgy Twitter likes and follows. The phrase has since become a coded way for transphobes to propagate their views while seemingly expressing simple fondness of a popular author. Billboards and signs featuring the phrase have been commissioned by transphobes such as Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull.[6][55] A cottage industry of stickers, shirts, and other junk featuring the phrase has sprung up. Now TERFS are more likely to enthusiastically proclaim their love of J. K. Rowling than Harry Potter fans. The variant "I Stand With Rowling" is also commonly used.	0

From the main Wikipedia page for "identitarianism":  The Identitarian movement or Identitarianism is a pan-European nationalist, far-right political ideology asserting the right of European ethnic groups and white peoples to Western culture and territories claimed to belong exclusively to them. Originating in France as Les Identitaires ("The Identitarians"), with its youth wing Generation Identity, the movement expanded to other European countries during the early 21st century. Building on ontological ideas of the German Conservative Revolution, its ideology was formulated from the 1960s onward by essayists such as Alain de Benoist, Dominique Venner, Guillaume Faye and Renaud Camus, who are considered the main ideological sources of the movement.  Identitarians promote concepts such as pan-European nationalism, localism, ethnopluralism, remigration, or the Great Replacement, and they are generally opposed to globalisation, multiculturalism, Islamization and extra-European immigration. Influenced by New Right metapolitics, they do not seek direct electoral results, but rather to provoke long-term social transformations and eventually achieve cultural hegemony and popular adhesion to their ideas.	1

But it's in fact used to describe a particular group of people: Latinos, in particular Mexicans ‚Äî even though many unauthorized immigrants can and do come from places outside Latin America.  In White Backlash, UC Berkeley political scientists Zoltan Hajnal and Marisa Abrajano noted the phenomenon: "Americans tend to reserve their most negative sentiments for so-called illegal immigrants, but when asked about immigrants as a whole, Mexican Americans, or even Latinos, the answers tend not to differ all that much."  Haney-L√≥pez explained that this is a classic use of coded language. Since it's describing an action, politicians can say they're targeting criminal wrongdoing, not a certain group of people. But what they're really tapping into is fears of brown people flooding across the border and reshaping the US from the inside.	1

However, during the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propaganda claimed the Illuminati were a subversive element which served Jewish elites who were behind global capitalism and Soviet communism (see Jewish capitalist, Jewish communist) and were plotting to create a New World Order (see New World Order). This conspiratorial stance on the Illuminati, as well as its related conspiracy theory of Freemason-controlling Jews, are built on classic antisemitic themes, including the notion of Jewish control over the world, the meddling by Jews in global politics, and the Jewish plot for complete power over world governance (see control).	1

"It also helps her in walking that line between Blue Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter."	0

By use of this loaded language, the campaign attempted to force critics to either accept the posters' message (despite being pushed by far-right white supremacist groups) or to say that "it's not okay to be white" (an obviously absurd and bigoted statement). The campaign has expected the posters to be taken down so "normies" can realize how the media hate white people and therefore try to recruit them to the white supremacist cause. 	1
job creators	job creator; job creators; job creation	I think raising taxes on small businesses would be a mistake. It would hurt our economy. I'm running against a fellow who's promised $2.2 trillion in new Federal spending so far, and we haven't even got to the stretch run yet. So they said, "How are you going to pay for it?" He said, "Oh, that's simple. We'll just tax the rich." You run up the top two brackets of the individual income taxes, you're taxing about a million small businesses here in America. Seventy percent of new jobs in America are created by small businesses, and you're taxing the job creators.	George W.

Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus‚Äôs 12 disciples, received 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus to the religious authorities. Although Jesus and all 12 disciples were Jews, the Western world‚Äîthrough art, literature, music, and tradition‚Äîchose to depict Judas as the Jew who sold out his Savior for money. Thus, the name Judas became synonymous with traitor, contributing to the persecution of Jewish communities for two millennia.

But in reality this isn‚Äôt how the term has functioned, either historically or more recently. Instead, the phrase is used to exclude rather than include. Despite implying that Jews are part of this resurrection of Judeo-Christian values, Trump in no way intends a campaign to Make Hanukkah Great Again. His ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian values‚Äù are about protecting Christmas, and about protecting Christians ‚Äì at the exclusion of others. ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian‚Äù is now most often used to draw a line between imagined Christian values and a perceived (but false) threat of Muslim immigration.   Time and again, when Farage and Trump use the term, what they really imply is an ‚Äúus-versus-them‚Äù division between the West and Islam. This is not about the inclusion of Jews in the values of these nations, then, but about the xenophobic exclusion of an ‚Äúother‚Äù. Invoked in anti-immigration rhetoric with the goal of excluding Muslims, this phrase is actually used to scaffold a false narrative about Christians being persecuted, threatened or besieged, which gives motivation for the protection of ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian values‚Äù. In fact, Christians are not persecuted in the countries where Farage and Trump make their homes.	1

The plan alleges a conspiracy that centers around Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1899‚Äì1972), the founder of the Paneuropean Union. Coudenhove-Kalergi was an Austrian politician whose father was an Austro-Hungarian diplomat and whose mother was Japanese. Coudenhove-Kalergi was initially antisemitic, like his father. After he began researching his book, Das Wesen des Antisemitismus, however, he concluded that antisemitism was primarily based on religious bigotry, and subsequently ceased to be an antisemite. In his 1925 book, Praktischer Idealismus, Coudenhove-Kalergi wrote, "Der Mensch der fernen Zukunft wird Mischling sein. Die heutigen Rassen unt Kasten werden der zunehmenden √úberwindung von Raum, Zeit und Vorurteil zum Opfer fallen." which has been translated into English as: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice." Coudenhove-Kalergi's forecast was an optimistic view of racial-mixing that contrasted with Madison Grant's similar but pessimistic and racist view.  The conspiracy theory itself alleges that Coudenhove-Kalergi wanted the envisioned mixed-race world to be ruled by Jewish elites, and that one of Coudenhove-Kalergi's goals was the destruction of Europe. This conspiracy theory overlaps with the white genocide and Great Replacement conspiracy theories among neo-Nazis.	1

This is a further reference by Blizzard to the Korean language word for 'laugh' (or more literally, 'ha ha ha'), kekeke („Öã„Öã„Öã), commonly seen in Starcraft. Used the same way by 4chan, later leading to the discovery of an Egyptian deity by the same name who happened to be a frog, thus linking this to the Pepe meme. The superlative is "topkek" or "top kek," which is also reference to a Turkish snack food. Kekistan is a fictional ethnicity that lets alt-righters use a Nazi flag as a "meme". It replaces the Nazi symbol with "K"s, and the Iron Cross with 4chan's logo. Kekistan was popularized in part by Sargon of Akkad.	1

Despite the decline in population and territorial defeat, the Khazars continued to be mentioned throughout history‚Äî especially as one of the first groups to adopt Judaism. By the 8th or 9th century, antisemitic conspiracy theories began forming around the Khazars‚Äô reported conversion to Judaism. This spurred antisemitic beliefs that they were building a secret empire which sought widespread control through financial gains. Given that the Khazars moved into and settled in Eastern Europe, antisemites push the conspiracy that Ashkenzai Jews‚ÄîJews descending from Eastern Europe‚Äîare not ‚Äúreal Jews‚Äù and are working to infiltrate other nations on their quest for world domination (see ‚Äúnot the real Jews‚Äù). The Khazar trope is also used to undermine the Jewish connection to Israel, and therefore Israel‚Äôs right to exist, because it falsely says Jews originated from the northern Caucasus region and were part of the Turkic empire‚Äîand not the Land of Israel.	1

Politicians use the phrase to signal that people of color are inherently criminal, and that we defy laws for no good reason. It implies that extra measures, such as broken windows policing, which promotes harsh punishment strategies under the belief that tolerating minor infractions encourages more serious violent crimes, need to be implemented in order to uphold the law.  Richard Nixon used the rhetoric of ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù in 1968 to appeal to white voters who were angry about integration. He claimed that he was a candidate for the ‚Äúsilent majority,‚Äù the other population of whites who weren‚Äôt protesting social injustices like Jim Crow and the Vietnam War.  With the exception of Trump saying we need more ‚Äúlaw and order,‚Äù which would directly impact Black and Latinx neighborhoods, the phrase isn‚Äôt used much anymore. However, the message behind it still resonates with conservatives and liberals alike.  When groups like Black Lives Matter use civil disobedience, like when they shut down the 405 Freeway in Inglewood, CA last year, similar rhetoric to ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù was used to police their actions. Liberals and conservatives alike objected to BLM because they claimed that the protests were ‚Äúdisrupting people‚Äôs lives‚Äù and ‚Äúpromoting rioting and violence.‚Äù In that case, upholding the status quo and obeying the law was the most important thing, instead of recognizing that the laws are unjust and need to be fixed. 	1

As with other terms here, it has, of course, made it harder for non-transphobic lesbians to talk about legitimate discrimination against lesbians, and to describe how it differs from homophobia against gay men. Among non-TERFs the more inclusive, gender-neutral term homophobia is preferred in most cases when not referring to the intersection of misogyny and homophobia proper, whereas TERFs often use the term lesbophobia specifically to attack trans people and the broader LGBT community.	0

These detransitioners are mostly cis women who identified as trans men for a time and now regret receiving HRT, top surgery, or hysterectomies. They have stated that, although certain aspects of medical transition cannot be reversed, they wish to "feel emotionally and psychologically complete."  Not all detransitioners are TERFs. However, the lizard emoji is often seen as a TERF dogwhistle. Psychologist and author Devon Price has cautioned that one should be "very skeptical and on alert" if they see someone with a "lizard in their bio" on social media commenting on "gender, sexuality, 'protecting children,' feminism, or trans issues." Price has written about his own brief experience with detransition. Ky Schevers, another prominent retransitioner and ex-TERF, has linked the lizard emoji's symbolism to TERF erasure of tran men: "Autotomy is when some animals, like lizards & sea cucumbers, shed a body part in order to escape from a predator & then later regrow the lost part. The idea was that detrans women had shed their femaleness to try to escape the dangers of patriarchy but were now regrowing it." TERFs frequently argue that cis women transition in an attempt to escape misogyny or lesbophobia.	0

One such example is the phrase "middle class," which is often deployed by conservative politicians to refer not just to members of the middle class, but to white members of the middle class in particular.  "'Middle class' stands as a signifier for whites," Haney-L√≥pez argued. "It stands in opposition to the word 'poor,' which over the last 40 or 50 years has come to be associated with people of color."  "Middle class" also stands in contrast to "inner city" and "urban," which were deployed after white flight out of the cities and into the suburbs during the 1950s and '60s.  "If you had to live near, work with, or send your children to school with blacks, you weren't actually middle class," Haney-L√≥pez said. "You needed to leave the city and move out to the suburbs. That was an economic marker, but it was also a racial marker of your middle-class status, because you were physically distant from African Americans."  It is a classic example of coded language. There are of course many, many middle-class black Americans. But because of how the term has been used over time, it's attained a different, pernicious meaning ‚Äî one that politicians and media have subtly embraced to play up likeness to and contrast from people of certain demographics.	1

It now refers to liberals generally, and it is applied by their left-wing critics. The word is now ubiquitous, popping up in almost any socialist polemic against the Democratic Party or the center-left. Obama‚Äôs presidency? It was ‚Äúthe last gasp of neoliberalism.‚Äù Why did Hillary Clinton lose? It was her neoliberalism. Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz? Neoliberals both.  The ubiquitous epithet is intended to separate its target ‚Äî liberals ‚Äî from the values they claim to espouse. By relabeling self-identified liberals as ‚Äúneoliberals,‚Äù their critics on the left accuse them of betraying the historic liberal cause.  Its basic claim is that, from the New Deal through the Great Society, the Democratic Party espoused a set of values defined by, or at the very least consistent with, social democracy or socialism. Then, starting in the 1970s, a coterie of neoliberal elites hijacked the party and redirected its course toward a brand of social liberalism targeted to elites and hostile to the interests of the poor and the working class.  The Democratic Party has evolved over the last half-century, as any party does over a long period of time. But the basic ideological cast of its economic policy has not changed dramatically since the New Deal. American liberals have always had some room for markets in their program. Democrats, accordingly, have never been a left-wing, labor-dominated socialist party. (Union membership peaked in 1955, two decades before the party‚Äôs supposed neoliberal turn, and has declined steadily since.) They have mediated between business and labor, supporting expanded state power episodically rather than dogmatically. The widespread notion that ‚Äúneoliberals‚Äù have captured the modern Democratic party and broken from its historic mission plays upon nostalgia for a bygone era, when the real thing was messier and more compromised than the sanitized historical memory.  The sudden ubiquity of the term in American politics ‚Äî at least among left-wing elites ‚Äî owes itself to two new developments. First, the Bernie Sanders campaign has inspired a new movement to remake the Democratic Party as a social-democratic labor party. Left-wing activists need a label for their opponents.  Second, the widely publicized influence of neoconservatives within the Bush administration changed the connotation of ‚Äúneo.‚Äù Whereas the prefix had once softened the term it modified ‚Äî the neoconservatives were once seen as the intellectually evolved wing of the right, in contrast to the Buchananite knuckle-draggers ‚Äî by the end of Bush‚Äôs term, it became an intensifier. A neoconservative was a conservative, but an even scarier one.  And so the term neoliberal frames the political debate in a way that perfectly suits the messaging needs of left-wing critics of liberalism. The uselessness of ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù as an analytic tool is the very thing that makes it useful as a factional messaging device for the left. The ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù rubric implicates the Democratic Party in the rightward drift of American politics that has in reality been caused by the Republican Party‚Äôs growing radicalism. It yokes the two parties together into a capitalist Establishment, against which socialism offers the only clear alternative. Obscuring the large gulf between Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, Paul Ryan and Barack Obama, is a feature of the term.	1

In 1903, the antisemitic forgery, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alleged, among many other falsities, that Jewish leaders were conspiring to control the world, including global politics, the world economy, and the media. The image of an octopus, with its tentacles wrapped around the world, or penetrating the globe, is an antisemitic representation of this canard. 	0

The alt-right use originated as bait for a /pol/ "prank" or trolling attempt, but as the media failed to fall into the trap, its usage rapidly shed whatever irony it had. As of January 2018, Snopes has listed the symbol as ambiguous as to whether it is an alt-right symbol or alt-right trolling. The sign is also used relatively innocuously in the "Circle Game". What makes it so devious is that it can be very difficult to know if someone is using it as a dogwhistle or as a harmless hand sign.	0

On its extreme edge, proponents have explicitly embraced the label of ‚Äúeco-fascism.‚Äù The alleged perpetrator of this month‚Äôs mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, claimed this identity, as did those in the 2019 El Paso, Texas, and Christchurch, New Zealand, massacres. Each blamed migrants, and people of color in general, for denigrating nature, and claimed that killing to lower population numbers was helpful for the environment ‚Äì a clear throwback, scholars say, to Nazi rhetoric.   In 1968, a bestselling book by Stanford professor Paul Ehrlich, ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb,‚Äù predicted that a growing number of humans would lead to everything from global famine to world war. It helped usher in years of environmental ideology focused on the alleged problem of ‚Äútoo many people.‚Äù  But as Dr. Hartmann and other scholars have pointed out, that ‚Äútoo many‚Äù was rarely conceptualized as white Anglo-Saxons. Indeed, the whole concept of overpopulation had roots in the early 20th-century eugenics movement, which advocated building a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù human race through selective breeding ‚Äì an approach that was deeply racist.   In recent years, most mainstream environmental organizations have backed away from, and even apologized for, their focus on overpopulation during the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äô70s. But the rhetoric still comes up regularly in conversations about climate, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. This is despite clear research that shows fossil fuel use in wealthier, whiter countries has had a far greater climate impact than the number of people in any high-birthrate nation.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard to get people to accept that consumption is the problem, not how many people there are,‚Äù Dr. Gill says. ‚ÄúAnd that when we talk about overpopulation, there‚Äôs a dog whistle there that a lot of people don‚Äôt even realize that they‚Äôre blowing.‚Äù	1

The alt-right is fond of ironically using "oy vey", because it makes them feel edgy. "Oy vey" is seen in "Oy vey, the goyim know, shut it down." (implying that Jews are part of a worldwide shadowy conspiracy) or "Oy vey, remember the 6 trillion." (implying that the Holocaust was faked to guilt-trip people into supporting some "Jewish agenda").  Oy vey! is a common expression among Jews in the Yiddish language to express dismay or exasperation. Oy vey in the English language means "oh, woe!" or "woe is me". It has become part of a stereotypical Jewish vocabulary along with the likes of "shalom" and "mazel tov". Even among non-Yiddish speakers and non-Jews, it is a very familiar Jewish saying.  Originally, the word had no racist connotations and was used by both Jews and non-Jews. Recently though the word has been misappropriated and co-opted by the alt-right and by Anti-Semites as a way of mocking Jewish people and even to vandalise Jewish gravestones. "Oy vey, it's anuddah shoah!" has become a common way to mock any allegation of antisemitism. It is often used in conjunction with other anti-Semitic terms such as "the goyim know", "shekels" and "remember the 6 gorillion"". Just like Goy, "oy vey" has become an anti-Semitic term to demonize Jews, in this case for what the alt-right perceives as being part of a conspiracy. However, because of Poe's Law, it can be very difficult to distinguish ironic uses of "oy vey" and unironic uses, so be careful of distinguishing between the two uses.	0

personal responsibility	personal responsibility; individual responsibility	As we offer opportunity, we must also demand responsibility. The problems of our society will only be solved if there is an upsurge of personal responsibility, if individuals take it upon themselves to meet their obligations, do the right thing, and give something back to those around them.  No area cries out for greater personal responsibility than the quiet crisis of child support. No one should be able to escape responsibility for bringing a child into the world. That is our first and most fundamental duty. But today, too many fathers have tried to walk away from that obligation.

King and Smith (2014) argue that in the wake of the 1960s civil rights laws arguments about racial policy shifted ‚Äúfrom debates over segregation versus integration to disputes between colorbind and race-conscious policy choices‚Äù (958). ‚ÄúPersonal responsibility‚Äù as color-blind but racially coded language can be seen in Ronald Reagan‚Äôs rhetoric surrounding welfare queens (Cammett 2014, 2016). While King and Smith (2014) highlight the advantages of color-blind rhetoric for conservative coalition building and Republican electoral campaigns, this rhetorical tool was also used by Democrats such as Bill Clinton in his welfare reform of 1996 (Cammett 2016; Pappas 1996). The net effect of this dog whistle was to paint using welfare as a failure of personal responsibility with the unspoken implication that the failure was most acute on the part of Black Americans and the undeserving poor (Gilens 2009). Thus, the very concept of ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù needs to be understood as a strategic dog whistle used by politicians to signal opposition to expanding the welfare state on the grounds that ‚Äúirresponsible‚Äù Black Americans would abuse it.	1

political correctness	political correctness; politically correct	Ironically, on the 200th anniversary of our Bill of Rights, we find free speech under assault throughout the United States, including on some college campuses. The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the land. And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudice with new ones. It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expression off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits.  What began as a crusade for civility has soured into a cause of conflict and even censorship.

Trump railed against it in his campaigning, while also famously referring to Mexicans as ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and calling for a Muslim ban. Since then, it has become clear to increasing numbers of Americans that Trump‚Äôs attacks on political correctness are a form of racially coded messaging used to stoke the fires of the grievances and fear some White people feel. White power extremists have always heard these racist dog whistles loud and clear.  For some, political correctness remains a much needed corrective to structural racism and the sorts of identity-based injustices that have returned to public focus during the Trump administration‚Äîespecially after the killing of African American George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May. However, more often, the term is used in a negative manner, particularly by those on the right, to warn against Orwellian groupthink and threats to freedom of thought and speech. In the U.S., the term ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù burst into public discussion in the 1990s as part of a conservative critique that claimed identity politics was shutting down debate, especially in universities. A 1990 New York Times essay, ‚ÄúThe Rising Hegemony of the Politically Correct,‚Äù by the journalist Richard Bernstein, helped spark a controversy that has raged ever since. Of course, not everyone who attacks political correctness is a White power sympathizer.	1

Rehnquist was an outspoken critic of civil rights, with a track record going back to Brown itself. When that case was first argued, Rehnquist had been a law clerk to one of the justices hearing it, and had written a memo urging that segregation be upheld, averring that ‚ÄúPlessy v Ferguson was write and should be re-affirmed‚Äù. But in the decade since, Rehnquist had moderated his language, and by 1964 he couched his opposition to civil rights as support for property rights (that is, the right of property owners to discriminate racially), making him an ideal choice to help Goldwater recalibrate his message. Entitled ‚ÄúCivil Rights and the Common Good‚Äù, the talk reprised the property rights argument, but also took another rhetorical turn, masterfully co-opting the language of civil rights to oppose integration as a moral evil. 	1
protecting women and girls	protect women and girls; protecting women and girls; protecting women's spaces; protect women's spaces; defend women and girls; defending women and girls	The conflation of the category of sex with the category of ‚Äògender identity‚Äô hinders the protection of women and girls from violence perpetrated against them by men and boys. It increasingly enables men who consider that they have a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô to claim access to female single sex victim support services and spaces, as both service users and as service providers. This includes specialist single-sex provisions for women and girls who have been subject to violence, such as shelters and health care facilities. It also includes other services in which single-sex provision is crucial to the promotion of the physical safety, health, privacy, and dignity of women and girls. The presence of men in female single-sex spaces and services undermines the role of these services in protecting women and girls, and could make women and girls vulnerable to violent men who may claim a female ‚Äògender identity‚Äô.

But this term has taken a new shape to stoke fears of Islam and Muslim people as a whole.  The most concrete proof of this is that fears over radical Islam have been used by many politicians to push for policies that broadly target Muslims. For example, on the presidential campaign trail, Jeb Bush called for preferential treatment of Syrian refugees who are Christian while having Muslims go through a more restrictive process, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul voted for a legislative amendment that would halt all immigration from dozens of Muslim countries with terrorist networks, and Donald Trump called for an all-out ban on Muslims traveling to the US.  Again, all these policies, as politicians describe them, are meant to fight "radical Islam." But they end up targeting all Muslims, even though most of them want nothing to do with extremism or terrorism.	1

The term is purposely broad to imply that people are fighting for their general religious rights ‚Äî when it's actually about protecting someone's "religious freedom" to discriminate against LGBTQ people.  The case of Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk Kim Davis shows the term's coded use. Davis and her supporters argued that she was merely standing up for her religious freedom. But what she was actually standing up for was her ability to deny same-sex couples their constitutional right to marry by refusing to let her government office issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.  Similarly, advocacy groups have pushed "religious freedom" laws around the country to allow discrimination ‚Äî particularly in restaurants and other places that serve the public ‚Äî against LGBTQ people. (Legal experts, however, argue these laws could not be used to legally justify discrimination.)  "Religious freedom," then, is a term that sounds good on its face, since Americans by and large support letting people practice their chosen faith in peace. But given the context in which it's commonly used, it now carries an anti-LGBTQ sentiment to it, also implying LGBTQ people are inherently antithetical to religion itself.	1

The accordionist in the recording, Novislav ƒêajiƒá, was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment for the murder of 14 people during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. A still frame of ƒêajiƒá‚Äôs face from the recording (he‚Äôs in military fatigues and playing an accordion), subsequently became a 4chan meme, known as "Dat Face Soldier".

After¬†Brown v. Board of Education...in some places, the desegregation efforts consisted of, basically, striking all references to race but otherwise doing little else to end desegregation. ¬†The "white" high school was no longer legally the white high school, but still had a nearly all-white student body, and the same went for the "black" high school. ¬†In these districts, the DOJ eventually had to sue the district in federal court and have a federal judge order the school district to comply with¬†Brown¬†-- in some cases, these lawsuits continued for decades. ¬†In districts that were sued to desegregate, so long as the lawsuit was still pending (meaning that a federal judge had not declared the school system to be unitary), even the smallest change to attendance boundaries would have to be approved by a federal judge before it could go into effect. ¬†And forget about opening a new school or closing a school -- those had to be approved as well. ¬†In some cases, judges even took the step of¬†ordering¬†changes to attendance boundaries or school closings -- frequently, the latter step would be taken to close the old black school and send the students to the old white school once it became clear that the resistance to desegregation among the white population was too strong to integrate the school district any other way. ¬†(When¬†this¬†happened, white flight was the usual result -- once federal courts overcame the resistance to desegregation, whites would frequently send their children to private schools or move to a nearby school district that had fewer black students in it.)  So, Republican calls for "local control" of schools hearken back to the massive white resistance to desegregation. ¬†Local control, in their parlance, meant freeing the school district from control by a federal judge. ¬†Now it's frequently used as an assault on federal mandates like Common Core and No Child Left Behind, but the history of the term makes it clear that, at least to some people, "local control" is a dog whistle in the same vein as "state's rights."	0

TERFs in the UK have co-opted the term as a euphemism for their crusade against young people's access to transition care. In December 2020, they succeeded in effectively banning transition care for people under 16 in the country, and immediately switched to calling for limiting adults' access.	1
save women's sports	save women's sports; save girls' sports; protect women's sports	Last June, biking champion Kate Weatherly, who identifies as a trans woman, lamented¬†the new exclusion¬†of trans-woman-identified athletes from certain women‚Äôs sports. The rules now applied to women‚Äôs swimming would ban Weatherly from women‚Äôs biking if they were applied there as well. These comments led the hashtag¬†#savewomenssports¬†to trend on Twitter, showing that many people welcome new rules that keep women‚Äôs sports open only to biological females. This idea is controversial, but it shouldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶So, if what we mean by ‚Äúwoman‚Äù is ‚Äúadult human female,‚Äù trans women are not women.

Similar to the "bathroom scare", the intent of the trope is to baselessly portray trans women as a grave threat to cis women and to whip up a moral panic around the trope to harm trans women and their well-being. The trope is primarily used to ridicule all trans people, and hysterical articles about "save women's sports" are frequently illustrated with carefully selected, non-flattering pictures of masculine-looking trans women who are not very representative of trans women. Very few trans women are in fact taking any part in competitive women's sports at all, and many trans women are afraid of coming into contact with that kind of arenas. Yet this spurious trope of very limited relevance gets disproportionate attention in transphobic discourse even in mainstream media outlets. The trope conveniently ignores that many cis men and women have significant biological and other advantages compared to other people of the same cis gender.	1

Never has a nation seemed to have had more and enjoyed it less‚Ä¶  We have heard a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the sixties in which the word "war" has perhaps too often been used--the war on poverty, the war on misery, the war on disease, the war on hunger.

We must declare and win the war against the criminal elements which increasingly threaten our cities, our homes, and our lives.

They normally upgrade the slogan to ‚Äúhard-fought sex-based rights‚Äù or ‚Äúhard-won sex-based rights‚Äù, for additional emphasis. Rebecca dismantles this ahistorical nonsense in her article. See also: How did public bathrooms get to be separated by sex in the first place? on the ‚Äúseparate spheres‚Äù ideology of the 19th Century.  Now, the fundamental point is that ‚Äúsex-based rights‚Äù, by the plain English meaning of those words, cannot exist in a country that has equality law, like the UK. If your rights are equal, then they cannot be based upon your sex, by definition. The phrase flatly contradicts the central principles of our equality law ‚Äî see the Equality Act 2010 statute, guidance, and particularly the statutory code of practice.  So, what do anti-trans people mean when they use this phrase? They rarely explain, because it‚Äôs mostly a dog-whistle: a rallying slogan much like ‚Äúfamily values‚Äù for religious conservatives, which sounds wholesome but is a deniable and slippery code-word for a whole raft of unpleasant bigotry.	1

But in fact they‚Äôre both engaged in jihad, and they‚Äôre both seeking to impose the same end state, which is to replace Western civilization with a radical imposition of Shariah.

To be clear, there is absolutely no chance of Sharia law going into effect anywhere in the US. Still, politicians have stoked fears about it since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Some states, including, most recently, South Carolina, have even moved to ban Sharia law in state courtrooms. (Courts routinely consider foreign law when overseeing, for instance, the end of marriages that happened in other countries, but they don't enforce Sharia law.) There's even a website, BanShariaLaw.com, dedicated to the bans.  Fears of Sharia law play into the idea that Muslims are infiltrating the US and threatening to impose their ways on other Americans, so everyone should fear even Muslims who appear moderate. This is, once again, a way of lumping the majority of Muslims ‚Äî who want nothing to do with extremism ‚Äî into the same category as extreme followers of the religion.	1

In the 1968 campaign, Nixon praised the ‚Äúforgotten Americans, the nonshouters, the nondemonstrators‚Äù ‚Äî hard-working, tax-paying Americans whose values were under siege by antiwar protesters, urban rioters, criminals and antipoverty liberals.

The administration worked on an internal ‚Äúblue-collar strategy‚Äù to finesse the economic liberalism and cultural conservatism of white working-class Democrats viewed as potential Republican voters. The White House even orchestrated the formation of a National Black Silent Majority Committee to represent African-Americans being ‚Äúshouted down by a handful of militants.‚Äù  Nixon was always careful to say that black Americans were part of the silent majority, but his populist agenda targeted white voters who believed that the civil rights and antiwar movements had gone too far. ‚ÄúEnough Is Enough,‚Äù a manifesto circulated by conservative groups in the late 1960s, spoke for the Americans who ‚Äúpay taxes to provide schools for sit-ins, books for burning, rallying points for off-campus riots and study courses in anarchism.‚Äù During the 1972 campaign, Nixon invited ‚Äúthose millions who have been driven out of their home in the Democratic party ... to join us as members of a new American majority.‚Äù	1
single parent	single parent; single-parent household; single mom; single mother	Perhaps the most insidious effect of welfare is its usurpation of the role of provider. In States where payments are highest, for instance, public assistance for a single mother can amount to much more than the usable income of a minimum wage job. In other words, it can pay for her to quit work. Many families are eligible for substantially higher benefits when the father is not present. What must it do to a man to know that his own children will be better off if he is never legally recognized as their father? Under existing welfare rules, a teenage girl who becomes pregnant can make herself eligible for welfare benefits that will set her up in an apartment of her own, provide medical care, and feed and clothe her. She only has to fulfill one condition‚Äînot marry or identify the father.

For example, stigmatizing metaphors such as the ‚ÄúWelfare Queen‚Äù were built on longstanding race and gender stereotypes and widely held beliefs. These perceptions persisted despite the fact that for most of the history of AFDC, these mothers were routinely restricted from accessing benefits for which they were eligible. Nevertheless, the ‚Äúpublic identity‚Äù of the Welfare Queen, though coined and popularized in the 1980s, had already been shaped in the public imagination by the 1960s.  [Assistant Labor Secretary, Daniel Patrick Moynihan‚Äôs] 1965 report, entitled The Negro Family: The Case For National Action, argued that the basic problem for the Black population was male unemployment and the low wages Black workers received. Most people agreed with that basic premise. The Report, however, concentrated on the instability of Black family life, particularly the ‚Äúproliferation of the single-parent or female-headed family and its illegitimate offspring.‚Äù Moynihan considered these to be the major causes of what he called a ‚Äútangle of pathology‚Äù that ‚Äúhelped to mire many Blacks in poverty.‚Äù In short, Black families‚Äô failure to adapt to the family wage paradigm created internal conditions through its matriarchal structure that were self-replicating and intergenerational, including poor school performance, street crime, delinquency, and drug use.	1

The sonnenrad appears in the traditional symbology of many countries and cultures, including Old Norse and Celtic cultures. It has countless variations; the swastika and similar rounded variants are actually sonnenrad forms, as are certain versions of the Celtic Cross. In Nazi Germany, the Nazi Party, the SA and the SS all used sonnenrad symbology at times, which has led neo-Nazis and other modern white supremacists to adopt such images. One sonnenrad version in particular is popular among white supremacists: two concentric circles with crooked rays emanating from the inner circle to the outer circle. Often white supremacists will put another hate symbol such as a swastika in the center of the inner circle.Because sonnenrad imagery is used by many cultures around the world, one should not assume that most sonnenrad-like images necessarily denote racism or white supremacy; rather, they should be analyzed carefully in the context in which they appear.	0

In other words, while "states' rights" is a pretty racially neutral issue, you just have to look at what was happening at the moment to realize that everyone knew it translated to the right of states to resist federal mandates to integrate schools and society. 	1

It is becoming blue. The white-to-blue shift moves the axis of personal and political identity from ancestry to affiliation with law enforcement. To be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù is now to accept and endorse the absolute necropolitical (the power to administer death) authority of police. To be ‚Äúblue‚Äù is to bring together all the tangled desires and frustrations connoted by whiteness into a spatialized subjugation to police authority. The resulting form of identification is a new form of nationalism. It has flags; it demands violence; and it exults in its own presumed superiority. This shift was visibly evident in the performance of the presidential election campaign by Trump‚Äôs followers, with their trucks, flags, guns, and banners.  Since the challenge to segregation in the 1950s, policing has presented itself as a ‚Äúthin blue line‚Äù against disorder ‚Äî a dog-whistle connecting the Civil Rights Movement to the mobility of Black people and white fears about the loss of a permanent, racialized social hierarchy. The repeated descriptions of US cities where protests were organized against police violence as ‚Äúanarchist‚Äù this summer and autumn followed that logic. Unspoken but understood is that the areas which the blue line protects are white spaces: the largely segregated regions where white people mostly live.	0

But over time, it has been used so often to refer to black people that it began to carry its own connotation ‚Äî the racist idea that black people are criminals or violent.  Take, for instance, the Baltimore protests. Were all the protesters in Baltimore, who were demonstrating against Freddie Gray's death in the hands of police, rioting and looting? No, but they were broadly labeled as such, even by the mayor and the president.  In comparison, one does not see the same kind of labeling with white rioters, which media outlets like CNN have labeled as, for example, "rowdy" in past instances.  As these kinds of contrasts present themselves in media, it becomes clear that the word "thug" is used to describe not merely criminal or violent behavior, but behavior from black men in particular.   	1

In theory, this should work for everyone ‚Äì who wants to live somewhere that lets bad criminals go?  ‚ÄúTough on crime‚Äù is primarily used as a code for ‚Äútough on Black and Latinx people, who are dangerous!‚Äù Tough-on-crime politicians are generally always in support of increased police presence and harsh punitive measures for ‚Äúnon-violent‚Äù crimes, which have historically not only put people of color in jails, but in many cases, have caused their murders at the hands of the police.  Bill Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù speeches during his presidential campaigns in the 1990s were used to sway white voters toward the ‚ÄúNew Democrats.‚Äù Unlike previous Democrats, Clinton‚Äôs campaign promises leaned more to the right and included his support for things, such as supporting the death penalty and increased welfare restrictions. Clinton spoke about how it was important to crack down on ‚Äúinner city‚Äù criminals in order to make the country safer. He later created policies such as the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which expanded measures that doled out harsh sentences. Among other things, it increased funding for prisons and implemented a ‚Äúthree strikes‚Äù mandatory life sentence policy that locked up many Black and Latinx for minor offenses.

Trump supporters say Americans have become too politically correct when they wish people happy holidays, a neutral term that can be used for people who celebrate Hanukkah, Eid al-Adha or any other religious holiday that takes place around the same time as Christmas. But critics counter that Trump is promoting a version of the holidays that excludes members of other religions, and that his crusade to bring back Christmas is part of a larger attempt by the president to define America as a country for white Christians alone.  "I see such invocations of Christmas as a kind of cypher, what some would call a dog whistle.

And who wouldn‚Äôt want to fight terror and defend our freedom? What isn‚Äôt explicit is that the ‚Äúterror‚Äù that many politicians want us to go to war against are actually people of Arab and Muslim descent, who ‚Äúfor no reason at all,‚Äù hate everything the US stands for (like freedom and women‚Äôs rights).  Proponents of fighting the ‚Äúwar on terror‚Äù often push for more military funding, invasions into other countries, and stricter immigration laws ‚Äì all in the name of keeping (white) Americans safe from evil Arab and Muslim people.   Immediately after 9/11, George W. Bush declared we would be going to war with all terrorists capable of harming the US, and created a large-scale military campaign in order to do so. In particular, Bush cited North Korea, Iraq, and Iran as countries that were hiding weapons of mass destruction and that actively trampled on their citizen‚Äôs rights. In his 2002 State of the Union address, he said these nations ‚Äúconstitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world.‚Äù This also led to nationwide acts of racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia against all people coded as Muslim and Arab. According to the FBI, hate crimes against Muslim people or people believed to be Muslim went up 1600% after 9/11.  Muslims, Sikhs, Arabs, South Asians, and people perceived to be members of these groups in the United States have been continuously stereotyped as anti-American terrorists and have been brutalized and forced to apologize for it. Two Indian men, for instance, were shot in a Kansas bar in February by a white man who yelled, ‚ÄúGet out of my country!‚Äù The suspect gloated that he killed two Iranian men. Last year, a new study released by California State University, San Bernardino found that hate crimes against Muslims were up 78% in 2015. In addition to domestic hate crimes, the US continues to bomb countless Muslim-majority countries while simultaneously banning Muslim refugees from entering, all in the name of ‚Äúkeeping America safe.‚Äù	1

Prominent Democrats such as Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer, as well as feminists, have used the phrase to criticize proponents of these laws as trying to force their social views on women through legislation.The slogan has been used to describe Republican policies in areas such as access to reproductive health services, particularly birth control and abortion services; the definition of rape for the purpose of the public funding of abortion; the prosecution of criminal violence against women; and workplace discrimination against women.  While used in other contexts, and prior to 2010, it became a common slogan in American political discourse after the 2010 congressional elections. The term is often used to describe opposition to the contraceptive mandate in Obamacare and policies to defund women's health organizations that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. The concept again gained attention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Republican nominee Donald Trump drew notice for a history of inflammatory statements and actions toward women.  The phrase and the concept have been criticized by Republicans and some anti-abortion Democrats. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus described it as an over-simplified fiction advanced by Democrats and the media while other Republicans contended that such rhetoric was used as a distraction from President Barack Obama and the Democrats' handling of the economy. In August 2012, Todd Akin's controversial comments regarding pregnancy and rape sparked renewed media focus on the concept. Republicans have tried to turn the phrase against Democrats by using it to argue hypocrisy for not critiquing sex scandals of members within their party who have cheated, sexted, and harassed women, and for not supporting bills to combat sex-selective abortion.  RESEARCH NOTE: "war on women" may also be a transphobic dog whistle, with the covert meaning of trans people threatening the livelihoods of cis women. As with all dogwhistles, context is especially important.

welfare	welfare; welfare reform	This spring I will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that builds on the Family Support Act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. We'll say to teenagers, "If you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. We want families to stay together"; say to absent parents who aren't paying their child support, "If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across State lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe." People who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. But to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact. We'll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years. But after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service if necessary. That's the only way we'll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life.

In the process, this effort targeted segregation, for obviously poverty in nonwhite communities was deeply tied to racially closed workplaces, schools, and housing. As a result, welfare and integration became tightly linked, and hostility toward integration morphed into opposition to welfare. ‚ÄúThe positive liberties [that the War on Poverty] extended to African Americans, notes Jill Quadagno, a scholar of race and welfare, ‚Äúwere viewed by the working class as infringement on their negative liberties, the liberty for trade unions to discriminate in the selection of apprentices and to control job training programs; the liberty to exclude minorities from representation in local politics; the liberty to maintain segregated neighborhoods‚Äù. To talk of rank racial discrimination in unions, politics, and housing in the language of a perceived infringement on liberty may seem strange. Yet for many, this is how they experienced integration. It was a social experiment being forced on them by government, and therefore a governmental infringement on their liberty to exclude. Reagan‚Äôs campaign against welfare helped make the case for tax cuts by successfully using social programs like welfare, and its implicit connection to integration, to convince voters that the real danger in their lives came from a looming, intrusive, government.	1
welfare cheats	welfare cheat; welfare cheats	We will not accept the Enron-ization of America, where insider deals and corporate welfare tilt the playing field in favor of well-connected mega-businesses and political friends. Stand for fair play--not handouts, not special interests--just plain, old-fashioned, everyone-plays-by-the-same rules. In the name of fairness, stop the rogues in the financial-services industry who quietly steal families' homes and pensions. Reject welfare cheats, corporate cheats, or cheats of any other stripe. Speak to us of fundamental fairness, and we will believe again in what we can be.	Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts senator)	July 16, 2004	Special Report for The American Prospect	https://prospect.org/special-report/vital-middle/	racist	stereotype-based target group label	Formal/Offline	Black people who are lazy and take advantage of government social aid	Academic	Cammett (2014)	https://www.law.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/page-assets/faculty/pedagogy/ACammett-SSRN-id2457225-Deadbeat-Dads-Welfare-Queen.pdf	Martin Gilens‚Äôs research reveals that, even today, the American public holds two prevalent beliefs about welfare. First, that most people who receive welfare are Black, and second, that Blacks are less dedicated to working than other Americans. Hearing the tale of the Welfare Queen and believing that the government was privileging non-deserving loafers over hardworking people like them, would comport with many Americans‚Äô racial perceptions and, therefore, be cognitively plausible. The advantage of using metaphors is that it taps into an accepted communal system of values. By implying that committing acts of fraud was part of the character of the Welfare Queen trope, Reagan reinforced the ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù status of the recipient. Reagan, casting this story as truth, confirmed many White Americans‚Äô common sense of outrage over the deterioration of their country. As critical race scholar Richard Delgado notes, ‚Äú[t]he stories or narratives told by the ingroup remind it of its identity in relation to outgroups, and provide it with a form of shared reality in which its own superior position is seen as natural.‚Äù Moreover, by 1976, the ongoing assault on welfare recipients coincided with a period of high inflation, falling wages, post-Vietnam War humiliation, and civil-rights weariness. The Welfare Queen trope triggered an emotional response in a body politic already anxious, seething with resentment, and primed to create a scapegoat: a welfare cheat who was perceived to be living a lavish lifestyle at taxpayer expense. Reagan continued to symbolically deploy his polarizing approach throughout the primary season. He was not reticent to exploit Americans‚Äô racial fears, doing so consistently, selectively, and with language culturally resonant to each group of listeners.	1
welfare queen	welfare queen; welfare queens; the welfare queen	There's a woman in Chicago. She has 80 names, 30 addresses, 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veterans‚Äô benefits on four nonexisting deceased husbands. And she's collecting Social Security on her cards. She's got Medicaid, getting food stamps and she is collecting welfare under each of her names. Her tax-free cash income alone is over $150,000.	Ronald Reagan	February 14, 1976	Campaign speech in New Hampshire	https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/welfare-queen-becomes-issue-in-reagan-campaign-hitting-a-nerve-now.html	racist	stereotype-based target group label	Formal/Offline	Black woman who are lazy and take advantage of government social aid	Media	Jennifer Loubriel for Everyday Feminism	https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/politicians-racial-dog-whistles/	It‚Äôs used to imply that Black women on social programs like welfare are lazy people who don‚Äôt do anything to ‚Äúhelp themselves.‚Äù Instead, they have children to use up government money and the tax dollars of ‚Äúhard-working‚Äù (read: white) Americans to live luxuriously.  Ronald Reagan first hinted at this stereotype in 1976, while he was campaigning and promoting his anti-government assistance stance. In Reagan‚Äôs speeches, he never explicitly used the term ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù or ‚ÄúAfrican-American.‚Äù Instead, he drew upon stereotypes of Black people, such as the ‚Äúover sexualized woman‚Äù and the ‚Äúviolent big, Black buck‚Äù tropes, to draw the connection between race and criminality. These speeches implied that Black people were criminals who refused to work. Instead, they tricked the government by abusing welfare systems to buy themselves extravagant things. One of his speeches in particular spoke about how frustrating it was to buy a hamburger at the grocery store, when someone on welfare could buy a T-bone steak.  Because of this rhetoric, an increasing amount of restrictions are placed on public assistance programs, many of which make it even more impossible for people to pull themselves out of poverty. This is an issue because, as the Census Bureau data has proven, welfare programs are extremely effective. These programs aren‚Äôt a burden on society, but rather ways to help people and stimulate the economy.  These types of stereotypes about Black people ‚Äúliving off the government‚Äù still exist today and Black people are still demonized for needing public assistanc. For instance, back in 2012, then-GOP candidate Rick Santorum stated he was against welfare because he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant to make Black people‚Äôs lives better by giving them somebody else‚Äôs money.‚Äù In 2015, Gene Alday, a Republican politician from Mississippi, claimed that ‚Äúall the blacks are getting food stamps and what I call ‚Äòwelfare crazy checks‚Ä¶They don‚Äôt work.‚Äù  Research Note: Politicians have rarely used the actual term "welfare queen", but frequently invoke this portrayal (which Reagan popularized) as a racial dogwhistle. The media coverage of Linda Taylor (the "woman in Chicago") were primarily responsible for popularizing the term [https://newrepublic.com/article/154404/myth-welfare-queen, https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/15/archives/welfare-queen-becomes-issue-in-reagan-campaign-hitting-a-nerve-now.html ], with the term probably originating from the Chicago Tribune's reporting on Linda Taylor's welfare fraud trials in Fall 1974. 	1

The stunt was a clear affront to Black Lives Matter, which has been measured as the largest racial justice movement in history. Black models walked the runway wearing the same slogan. ‚ÄòAll lives Matter‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhite Lives Matter‚Äô have long served as violent retorts to the Black Lives Matter movement, used by white supremacists and hate groups, including the Ku Klux Klan.  Kanye West and Candace Owens sent a performative dog whistle to millions. Kanye knows very well that ‚Äòwhite lives‚Äô have never been targeted for oppression. Black folks, in contrast, are at the bottom of virtually every economic, social, and political measure because of centuries of individual and institutional racism. Building a world of Black freedom means upending systems that harm and building new systems of care. Ultimately this benefits everyone. When Black people get free, everybody gets free.	1

Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed first degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison. One was Willie Horton who murdered a boy in a robbery, stabbing him 19 times. Despite a life sentence, Horton received 10 weekend passes from prison. Horton fled, kidnapped a young couple, stabbing the man and repeatedly raping his girlfriend.

Bush, the one-term president who died on Friday at age 94, is often overlooked by history, despite having presided over the last truly bipartisan ‚Äúgrand bargain‚Äù and the end of the Cold War. But if there‚Äôs one context in which his name, along with that of another man, is regularly invoked, it‚Äôs when political campaigns make coded racist appeals to white voters.  Even as President Donald Trump usurps him with increasingly transparent racist attacks, George Bush Sr.‚Äôs ‚ÄúWillie Horton‚Äù ad remains the key reference point for dog-whistle politics.  The infamous ‚ÄúWillie Horton ad‚Äù was a 1988 presidential campaign TV spot created by Bush‚Äôs supporters that attacked his Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis for being soft on crime. Dukakis, the then-governor of Massachusetts, supported his state‚Äôs ‚Äúweekend pass‚Äù program, which allowed imprisoned individuals ‚Äî including those not eligible for parole ‚Äî to leave prison for a day or more to work or go home. (As the Washington Post noted at the time, it was introduced by a Republican governor, and most states had the same policy, including California under Ronald Reagan.)  The spot featured convicted murderer William ‚ÄúWillie‚Äù Horton, who had been able to escape while on such weekend furlough, and went on to rape a woman and stab her fianc√© in a brutal 1987 home invasion. It was widely condemned for playing on racial fears by featuring a black man‚Äôs mug shot and linking blackness with depravity.  The ad was intended to drive scared white people to the polls to vote for tough-on-crime Bush, seeking protection from black criminals like Horton and black-friendly candidates like Dukakis. As political-science professor Claire Jean Kim said in a 2012 PBS special, ‚Äúthe insinuation is, if you elect Gov. Dukakis as president, we‚Äôre going to have black rapists running amok in the country.‚Äù	1

The image of ‚Äúworking class‚Äù families is one that is largely coded as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù within the public imagination, frequently associated with rural, suburban and exurban communities. Rather than eliminating the use of this term, it is important to continue to expand its meaning, and the range of people whose image it evokes. One way to do that is to explicitly insert Black people into the narrative it carries, for instance, by talking about Black, white and other working class communities, or by talking about Black, white and other working families.	1
